Feature: Configuration
  Chaplin reads its configuration from a chaplin_config.json file at the root of you chaplin project.
  For testing purposes, the examples given here point to localhost, but any url can be used

  Scenario: Using a YAML configuration
    Given I have the following chaplin_config.yml file
    """
    api_url: http://localhost:1234
    """
    Then Chaplin connects to the api on port 1234

  Scenario: Using a json configuration
    Given I have the following chaplin_config.json file
    """
    {
      "api_url": "http://localhost:1234"
    }
    """
    Then Chaplin connects to the api on port 1234
